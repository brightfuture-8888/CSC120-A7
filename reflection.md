- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I decided to overload - 
Cafe class: name & name and address, House Class: name and address & name, address, # of floors, Library Class name and entrance fee & entrance fee and cost of wifi

In cafe class and house class, I thought overloading names and addresses was important because we could put in new names and new addresses in different libraries while they shared some structural similarities.
In library class, I wanted to make sure that each library got a different amount of the entrance fee. The first overloading constructor includes a name. I wanted to have a new name for a new library. The second overloading constructor asks to put the cost of wifi there because I thought it might be interesting to put it there, although the cost of wifi doesn't apply to other libraries. I wanted to create unique characteristics for the specific library.



- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Overall, I could deepen my understanding of CS in this class. I could tell myself what code I should make throughout the assignment because I had a solid idea of what I should do next, especially when I was trying to make a main for each class. I feel happy that I could do this assignment mostly by myself, and tried to do it by myself to know how much I understand about coding.
